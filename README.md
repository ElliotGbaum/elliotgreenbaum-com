My personal site. A dark field you walk through carrying a lantern. At the
centre is a projector that needs your light; switch it on and a short film
about me plays on the screen while you stand there and watch it.

**Live at [elliotgreenbaum.com](https://elliotgreenbaum.com).**

Built with TypeScript, [Three.js](https://threejs.org) and [Vite](https://vite.dev).
The film is drawn frame by frame on a 2D canvas and projected into the 3D
world. If WebGL or JavaScript is unavailable you get a plain HTML card instead.

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # typecheck + production build into dist/
```

`npm run verify` runs the site's own checklist (accessibility, keyboard,
phone width, the film's transport) against a preview build in real Chrome.
